The transportation model finds the best cost-efficient plan for warehouse demands based on production capacity. The results state unit quantity per plant to produce and where to ship.

0 status reveals a successful solution to minimize $132790. Plant A Warehouse 1 and Plant B Warehouse 2 will have demand reduced to zero and routed to the opposite plant. 

```{r}
# Initiate library to use
library(lpSolveAPI)
# Creating the model with an lp file
x <- read.lp("QMM_cwood19_6.lp")
#print(x)
solve(x)
o_val <- get.objective(x)
cat(sprintf("Minimum Cost: $%.2f\n", o_val))
get.variables(x)
get.constraints(x)
lp_results <- data.frame(LP_Variable = colnames(x), LP_Value = get.variables(x))
print(lp_results)
```
